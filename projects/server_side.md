# Server-Side Project

In this project you will be building the back-end for an application of your own design. Similar to your previous projects, you'll start with a back-end in this project before building a front-end for it in weeks 8 and 9. Unlike last time you'll be building the front-end for your own back-end and you'll be working individually.

You have **two weeks** to work on this project. How you manage your time is up to you, but we recommend careful planning and allowing a buffer for any unexpected issues, especially if you are exploring any new tech.

## Requirements

You will be building an API which will be accessed by a React app which you will build later in the course. For now you don't need to worry about the front-end, although bearing in mind what you want to be able to do with it will make designing the back-end easier. Your tech stack should include:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- An SQL database

You may handle the database integration in any way you wish (eg. JDBC, Hibernate, etc) and may add any additional libraries needed for features you wish to add. As part of the process you should produce:

- An entity relationship diagram laying out your database structure
- Class diagrams for your application
- A Kanban board breaking the project down into tasks (the GitHub projects tool is fine for this)
- A README file for your project describing what you are building, listing any extra dependencies added and giving any setup instructions.

We also want to see unit and/or integration tests for your code.

## Presentations

At the end of the second week you will present your work to your colleagues, trainers and client representatives. You will have **5 minutes** plus time to answer any questions. Your presentation shuold include:

- A description of the app you are working towards
- A brief discussion of the planning process
- A demo of the key features of the app
- Discussion of any code you are proud of, eg. an interesting feature you implemented or a challenging bug you fixed.

It **should not** include an open IDE or a line-by-line dissection of the code. For any code snippets you want to include you can either take a screenshot or use a tool such as [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/).

## Project Management

When you have created you GitHub repository post a link to it on Discord. Remember to push your code regularly - not only is it a useful backup, it makes it much easier to get help if the code is already online for a trainer to pull.

The office hours will operate as normal during the project weeks, but trainers will be available to answer questions outwith those hours too. We will **not** be available outside of normal working hours but we'll answer any questions as soon as we can. If you are experimenting with a new library or feature we may not have much experience with it, so if you need help come prepared with links to documentation and be able to tell us what you've tried so far.
