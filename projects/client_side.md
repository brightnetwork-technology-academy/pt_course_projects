# Client-Side Project

In the next two weeks you will be building the front-end for the client-side projects you worked on previously. You have **two weeks** to develop a React application which connects to the API you built. As before managing your time is up to you; we recommend thorough planning before you start coding!

## Requirements

The aim of this project is to build a React app and so you shouldn't need to spend much time tweaking your Spring app. Try to avoid adding/editing routes unless absolutely necessary.

In this project your tech stack should include:

- Your server-side app
- React
- Any necessary libraries to assist with features added to your backend, eg. authentication

Your planning should include:

- A Kanban board
- Wireframes
- A diagam showing the relationship between the React components
- A README file for your project describing what you are building, listing any extra dependencies added and giving any setup instructions.

You will need to configure CORS on your back-end before you can connect your React application.

## Presentations

At the end of the second week you will present your work to your colleagues, trainers and client representatives. You will have **5 minutes** plus time to answer any questions. Your presentation shuold include:

- A description of the app you are working towards
- A brief discussion of the planning process
- A demo of the key features of the app
- Discussion of any code you are proud of, eg. an interesting feature you implemented or a challenging bug you fixed.

It **should not** include an open IDE or a line-by-line dissection of the code. For any code snippets you want to include you can either take a screenshot or use a tool such as [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) or the [Polacode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode) extension for VSCode.

## Project Management

When you have created your GitHub repository post a link to it on Discord. Remember to push your code regularly - not only is it a useful backup, it makes it much easier to get help if the code is already online for a trainer to pull.

The office hours will operate as normal during the project weeks, but trainers will be available to answer questions outwith those hours too. We will **not** be available outside of normal working hours but we'll answer any questions as soon as we can. If you are experimenting with a new library or feature we may not have much experience with it, so if you need help come prepared with links to documentation and be able to tell us what you've tried so far.
